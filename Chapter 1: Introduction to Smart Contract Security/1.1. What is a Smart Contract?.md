# 1.1. What is a Smart Contract?

A **smart contract** is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. It runs on a blockchain, allowing for decentralized, trustless execution without the need for intermediaries. Smart contracts leverage blockchain’s inherent properties, such as immutability, transparency, and consensus, to automate and enforce contract terms in a secure and transparent manner.

## 1.1.1 Key Components of a Smart Contract

### 1.1.1.1 Code
Smart contracts are typically written in programming languages specific to the blockchain platform they are deployed on. The most commonly used language is **Solidity**, which is designed for Ethereum-based smart contracts. Other blockchain platforms may use different languages, such as **Vyper** (Ethereum), **Rust** (for Solana), or **Michelson** (for Tezos).

The code in a smart contract defines the logic, functions, and conditions under which the contract operates. It specifies rules such as:

- The conditions under which payments or assets are transferred.
- Conditions for contract termination or amendments.
- The rights and obligations of the parties involved.

### 1.1.1.2 Blockchain
Smart contracts run on a blockchain, a distributed ledger technology (DLT) that ensures transparency, immutability, and consensus. This means once a smart contract is deployed on the blockchain, the terms and code cannot be changed or tampered with without a majority consensus (depending on the blockchain's consensus mechanism, such as Proof of Work or Proof of Stake).

The blockchain provides the execution environment for smart contracts, ensuring that the rules defined in the contract are carried out in a decentralized manner.

### 1.1.1.3 The Contract's State
A smart contract has a state, which is a set of variables that reflect the contract’s current condition or the status of the agreement. These states can include balances, permissions, or any other data relevant to the contract’s execution. For example, in a token contract, the state might include user balances or transaction records.

Changes to the state occur when the conditions defined in the contract's code are met. These changes are recorded on the blockchain and are transparent and immutable.

### 1.1.1.4 Gas (Transaction Fees)
For a smart contract to execute its functions on the blockchain, the transaction must be processed, which often requires computational resources. In the case of Ethereum, these resources are measured in **gas**, a unit of computational work. Gas fees are paid in the blockchain’s native token (ETH in Ethereum) and serve as an incentive for miners (or validators in Proof of Stake) to process transactions and execute the contract’s logic.

## 1.1.2 How Smart Contracts Work

### 1.1.2.1 Deployment
A smart contract is deployed to the blockchain by an account (usually the developer’s or the organization’s wallet). This deployment is a transaction on the blockchain, and once confirmed, the contract is stored in a specific address on the blockchain.

### 1.1.2.2 Execution
Once deployed, the smart contract can be interacted with by sending transactions to its address. These transactions are processed based on the contract's logic and may result in a change in state (e.g., transferring tokens or assets).

### 1.1.2.3 Self-execution
Smart contracts execute automatically based on pre-defined conditions. If the conditions are met (e.g., a specific time or value), the contract performs the actions without any further intervention from external parties. For instance, a simple smart contract could automatically release a payment when goods are delivered and tracked via a trusted oracle.

### 1.1.2.4 Security and Immutability
Once deployed, the contract's code and the data within it cannot be modified (unless specified through upgradable contract patterns like proxy contracts). This immutability, while enhancing security, also places a responsibility on developers to ensure that the contract code is correct and secure before deployment.

## 1.1.3 Smart Contracts in Action

### 1.1.3.1 Example 1: Token Contract

One of the most common examples of a smart contract is the **ERC-20 token contract** on Ethereum. It governs the creation, transfer, and management of fungible tokens. When a user sends tokens from one wallet to another, the smart contract automatically updates the balances on the blockchain, ensuring that the transfer is transparent and irreversible.

### 1.1.3.2 Example 2: Non-Fungible Tokens (ERC-721)

The **ERC-721 token contract** standard governs the creation and management of **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** on Ethereum. Unlike ERC-20 tokens, each ERC-721 token is **unique** and represents ownership of a specific digital or physical asset. These assets could include digital art, real estate, collectibles, or gaming items.

#### Key Features of ERC-721:
- **Uniqueness:** Each token has a unique ID and metadata, distinguishing it from other tokens.
- **Ownership:** Tokens can be owned and transferred by individuals or entities.
- **Transferability:** Owners can sell or transfer their tokens securely via blockchain transactions.



### 1.1.3.3 Example 3: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocol
In DeFi protocols, smart contracts automate lending, borrowing, and trading without the need for intermediaries like banks. For example, a smart contract could lock a collateral asset and issue a loan in the form of another asset, such as stablecoins, based on certain terms (e.g., collateral value).

## 1.1.4 Advantages of Smart Contracts

- **Automation**: Executes automatically when conditions are met, reducing the need for intermediaries.
- **Transparency**: All participants can see the contract's code and transactions, which fosters trust.
- **Immutability**: Once deployed, the contract code cannot be altered, providing security against fraud and unauthorized changes.
- **Security**: The blockchain's cryptographic nature ensures that once a contract is executed, the results cannot be changed.

## 1.1.5 Challenges and Risks

While smart contracts offer numerous benefits, they are not without challenges:

- **Code Vulnerabilities**: Smart contracts are written by developers, and any mistakes in the code can lead to significant vulnerabilities. For example, **reentrancy attacks** can be exploited if the contract allows external calls to untrusted addresses.
- **Gas Fees**: Complex contracts can require high gas fees, making them expensive to interact with, especially during network congestion.
- **Irreversibility**: Once a smart contract’s logic is executed, the results are final and cannot be undone, even in cases of error or unintended outcomes.
